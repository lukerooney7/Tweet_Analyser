We completed the majority of this specification.
We completed all the basic requirements as well as the easy and medium ones including the "medium to hard" requirement.
We researched into the hard requirement of interactive visualsations but were unable to complete it in the time frame due 
to the constraints placed upon us (being in a reduced group size).
